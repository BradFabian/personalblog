The weather finally starts to cool, halloween is my favorite holdiay and contributing to open source becomes a monthly celebration. Hacktober Fest was started by <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> as a way to promote and celebrate contributing to open source projects. It‚Äôs been an annual event for the last 9 years. When you complete the challenge of 4 approved pull requests you get some swag. I have t shirts from the last five years however this year they let you plant a tree in your name. As much as I love their swag, I love that option and will do the tree this year.</p>

<p>What are open source projects?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs an style of sharing and collabrotive development so products are open and free to use by developers for developers. I‚Äôve been a huge fan of open source. As someone who is self taught it‚Äôs been a boone for my skills and even gained some friendships along the way.</p>

<p>If you want to grow your skills contribute to open source.
Hacktober Fest as this great resource for beginners :

<p>Also I enjoy helping out the MDN communtiy. A great place to start is bugzilla. 
They have bugs that are easy to fix yet they make you familiar with the mozilla development process.
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=good-first-bug">Bugzilla</a></p>

<p>My blog will morph and it‚Äôs voice will change. My posts might not be frequent but I‚Äôll try give quality.  I work in ecommerce and spend my time developing whatever my design and marketing departments desire. Current themes will be front end, jamstack and general web development topics that I find interesting.  The themes can and will change, I read and get inspired from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">smashing magazine</a>,<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> videos, Sir <a href="https://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>, <a href="https://tldr.tech/">tldr</a> and <a href="https://jamstack.email/">the jamstack</a> newsletters .  It‚Äôs a wonderful time to be a front end developer so let‚Äôs learn and grow together.</p>
