The weather finally starts to cool, halloween is my favorite holdiay and contributing to open source becomes a monthly celebration. Hacktober Fest was started by (Digital Ocean)[https://www.digitalocean.com/] as a way to promote and celebrate contributing to open source projects. It‚Äôs been an annual event for the last 9 years. When you complete the challenge of 4 approved pull requests you get some swag. I have t shirts from the last five years however this year they let you plant a tree in your name. As much as I love their swag, I love that option and will do the tree this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are open source projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs an style of sharing and collabrotive development so products are open and free to use by developers for developers. I‚Äôve been a huge fan of open source. As someone who is self taught it‚Äôs been a boone for my skills and even gained some friendships along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to grow your skills contribute to open source.
Hacktober Fest as this great resource for beginners :

&lt;p&gt;Also I enjoy helping out the MDN communtiy. A great place to start is bugzilla. 
They have bugs that are easy to fix yet they make you familiar with the mozilla development process.
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=good-first-bug&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog will morph and it‚Äôs voice will change. My posts might not be frequent but I‚Äôll try give quality.  I work in ecommerce and spend my time developing whatever my design and marketing departments desire. Current themes will be front end, jamstack and general web development topics that I find interesting.  The themes can and will change, I read and get inspired from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/&quot;&gt;smashing magazine&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/&quot;&gt;freecodecamp&lt;/a&gt; videos, Sir &lt;a href=&quot;https://wesbos.com/&quot;&gt;Wes Bos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tldr.tech/&quot;&gt;tldr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamstack.email/&quot;&gt;the jamstack&lt;/a&gt; newsletters .  It‚Äôs a wonderful time to be a front end developer so let‚Äôs learn and grow together.&lt;/p&gt;
