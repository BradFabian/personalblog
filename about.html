I really enjoy mentoring and watching my teams skillset grow. This Blog will be an offshoot of that. I'll have quick code tutorials , deep dive into project archtecture, thoughts on ecommerce tech and other technical related posts. I'm no expert but I'm always learning and hope this blog will inspire others too.
