# About Me

![Image of author of this blog: Brad ](./assets/images/bio.png)

🌊 My name is Brad and I'm an e-commerce manager. I manage a small team of technical and non technical memebers. I really enjoy mentoring and watching my teams skillset grow. This Blog will be an offshoot of that. I'll have quick code tutorials , deep dive into project archtecture, thoughts on ecommerce tech and other technical related posts. I'm no expert but I'm always learning and hope this blog will inspire others too.
