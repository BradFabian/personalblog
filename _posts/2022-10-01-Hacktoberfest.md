October is one of my favorite months. The weather finally starts to cool, halloween is my favorite holdiay and contributing to open source becomes a monthly celebration. Hacktober Fest was started by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as a way to promote and celebrate contributing to open source projects. It's been an annual event for the last 9 years. When you complete the challenge of 4 approved pull requests you get some swag. I have t shirts from the last five years however this year they let you plant a tree in your name. As much as I love their swag, I love that option and will do the tree this year.

What are open source projects?

It's an style of sharing and collabrotive development so products are open and free to use by developers for developers. I've been a huge fan of open source. As someone who is self taught it's been a boone for my skills and even gained some friendships along the way. 

If you want to grow your skills contribute to open source.
Hacktober Fest as this great resource for beginners :

Also I enjoy helping out the MDN communtiy. A great place to start is bugzilla. 
They have bugs that are easy to fix yet they make you familiar with the mozilla development process.
