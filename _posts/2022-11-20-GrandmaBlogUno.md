Grandma needs to show off her macrame. Can't deny th world of such a treat. Grandma wants a snazzy home page, an killer about me, a blog to show off her macrame and a way to contact her.  Lets use it as an excuse to create a blog in Eleventy. 

What's Eleventy??

Eleventy is a static site generator. It takes text files, markdown, JSON , remote data sources and puts it all into an api for the developer to grab and us eon the front end.
