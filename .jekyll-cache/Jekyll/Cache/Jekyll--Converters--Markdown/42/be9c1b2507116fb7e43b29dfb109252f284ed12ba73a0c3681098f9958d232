<p>October is one of my favorite months. The weather finally starts to cool, halloween is my favorite holdiay and contributing to open source becomes a monthly celebration. Hacktober Fest was started by (Digital Ocean)[https://www.digitalocean.com/] as a way to promote and celebrate contributing to open source projects. Itâ€™s been an annual event for the last 9 years. When you complete the challenge of 4 approved pull requests you get some swag. I have t shirts from the last five years however this year they let you plant a tree in your name. As much as I love their swag, I love that option and will do the tree this year.</p>

<p>What are open source projects?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s an style of sharing and collabrotive development so products are open and free to use by developers for developers. Iâ€™ve been a huge fan of open source. As someone who is self taught itâ€™s been a boone for my skills and even gained some friendships along the way.</p>

<p>If you want to grow your skills contribute to open source.
Hacktober Fest as this great resource for beginners :

<p>Also I enjoy helping out the MDN communtiy. A great place to start is bugzilla. 
They have bugs that are easy to fix yet they make you familiar with the mozilla development process.
