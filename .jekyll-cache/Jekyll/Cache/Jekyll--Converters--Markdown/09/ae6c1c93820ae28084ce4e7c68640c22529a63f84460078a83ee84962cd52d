I"{<p>October is one of my favorite months. The weather finally starts to cool, halloween is my favorite holdiay and contributing to open source becomes a monthly celebration. Hacktober Fest was started by (Digital Ocean)[https://www.digitalocean.com/] as a way to promote and celebrate contributing to open source projects. Itâ€™s been an annual event for the last 9 years. When you complete the challenge of 4 approved pull requests you get some swag. I have t shirts from the last five years however this year they let you plant a tree in your name. As much as I love their swag, I love that option and will do the tree this year.</p>
