<p>ðŸŒŠ My name is Brad and Iâ€™m an e-commerce manager. I manage a small team of technical and non technical memebers. I really enjoy mentoring and watching my teams skillset grow. This Blog will be an offshoot of that. Iâ€™ll have quick code tutorials , deep dive into project archtecture, thoughts on ecommerce tech and other technical related posts. Iâ€™m no expert but Iâ€™m always learning and hope this blog will inspire others too.</p>
