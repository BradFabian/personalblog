I"÷<p>What is the JAMstack or now itâ€™s Jamstack?</p>

<p>â€œA modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markupâ€
â€” Mathias Biilmann (CEO &amp; Co-founder of Netlify).</p>

<p>In 2016 Mathias Billmann presented the idea of using client side Javascript , APIs and Markdown at an Smashing Con 2016. This idea of decoupling backend and empowering the front end developers was revolutionary. Since than, the Jamstack has matured and is coming to its own. An developer can build blogs, small to medium business site, even base complex enteprise ecommerce archetitecture around its principles.   Many other sites that once was thought to only be defined by backend languages and data are being reimagined and the possibilties of creating an unique user experience are boundless.

<p>My blog will morph and itâ€™s voice will change. My posts might not be frequient but iâ€™ll try give quality.  I work in ecommerce and spend my time developing whatever my design and marketing departments desire. Current themes will be front end, jamstack and general web development topics that I find interesting.  The themes can and will change, I read and get inspired from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">smashing magazine</a>, <a href="https://tldr.tech/">tldr</a> and <a href="https://jamstack.email/">the jamstack</a> newsletters .  Itâ€™s a wonderful time to be a front end developer so letâ€™s learn and grow together.</p>
